# UYG332-IMAGE-PROCESSING-FINAL-PROJECT
# Image Processing Final Project

## Description

This repository contains a single Jupyter Notebook (`image_processing_tasks.ipynb`) that covers six core image processing tasks using Python and OpenCV:

1. Coloring a central patch on an image (`tf2_engineer.jpg`).
2. Generating and analyzing the negative of an image (`einstein.tiff`).
3. Applying logarithmic and inverse-log transforms (`pout.tiff`).
4. Performing unsharp masking in spatial and frequency domains (`moon.tiff`).
5. Filtering salt-and-pepper noise on a PCB image (`pcb.tiff`).
6. Contrast enhancement with homomorphic filtering and top-hat transform (`pollen.tiff`).

All Russian comments and strings in the notebook have been replaced with English equivalents.
